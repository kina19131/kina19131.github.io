Hello! This is Kina Kim. I am currently working as a Db2 database Cloud SWE at [IBM](https://www.forbes.com/companies/ibm/).\
Uhh... so what does that mean? If you shop at Loblaws, Costco, Winners or bank with RBC, Bank of America, we make that "Database" that stores your records - you are our customers! 

I've graduated from University of Toronto.\
I studied [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/), specializing in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/) - the AI/ML.  

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jepg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
