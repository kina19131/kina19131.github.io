I love exploring the city on a bike. I bike roughly 350 days out of 365 days./

    I love taking jump shots and that's not exception with bikes!

Biking is somewhat integrated into my life. Yes that means I also bike through Canadian winter too.

    Biking in the winter hits different, esp on days with good weather!

Bike feels like a small break out of dailylife. I have discovered many small neighborhoods near downtown toronto or even extending to missisauga and they are great getaway to empty my mind. It is so refreshing to hit the road and feel the wind.
