I love mother nature. Just taking some time between the trees and by the water, that's my dream way of taking time off.

I not only love being a part of the nature and camping or what not but I also love watching it! I love stargazing and I love any other nature-watching./
Check out the solar eclipse I saw with friends in 2024!

Love love absolutely love any kinds of body of water. I went into lake ontario in Mid November! My friends joked on the discrepency of my top half, super puffy jacket, and my bare feet in the water. I couldn't resist! And check out my shot of cute cute happy smiley stringray. I know, it always makes my day, hope it did yours too!
