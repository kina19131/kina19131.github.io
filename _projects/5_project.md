I start my morning with Coffee. Yes, am the one who's like "don't touch me before my coffee." I love that caffiene and I love the taste of coffee. I personally prefer chocolate note (dark chocolate) than sour taste. If you know any good local cafes in Toronto, please hit me up! Also if you want some good cafe recos, hit me up, and I only give away if we go together hehe

Took my friends to Korea as our grad trip. In the middle of our traditional dress, hanbok, experience, I could not resist from dragging my buddies into one of my fav coffee places.
