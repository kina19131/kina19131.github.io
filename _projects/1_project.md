I love taking pictures of Sunrise and Sunset. It gives a nice extra touch to my day. 
I especially love this picture because of the streetcar. It does add the Toronto aesthetic to my sunset pics.

In todays where everything is so bustle hustle, it is easy to forget to look around and enjoy your time here on Earth. 
I hope this reminds you to look up in the sky and admire the beautiful scenaries we get to enjoy!
