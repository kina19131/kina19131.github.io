It is so fun to take pictures of cityscapes and get reminded we are the little humans hustle bustling inside the forest of the buildings. 
Yes, it's been 6yrs since I lived in Toronto but I still take pictures of the CN tower when we have rly nice sky. 
Nice pictures of different cities also reminder of places I've visited as an avid traveller. There's different vibe to each cities and pictures capture that and bring me right back to that mood, that atmosphere, when I see them.

In todays where everything is so bustle hustle, it is easy to forget to look around and enjoy your time here on Earth. 
I hope this reminds you to look up in the sky and admire the beautiful scenaries we are part of.
